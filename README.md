* How to store data in the cloud using Firebase Firestore
* How to query and sort the Firebase database
* How to use Firebase for user authentication, registration and login
* How to work with UITableViews and how to set their data sources and delegates
* How to create custom views using .xib files to modify native design components
* How to embed View Controllers in a Navigation Controller and understand the navigation stack
* How to create a constants file and use static properties to store Strings and other constants
